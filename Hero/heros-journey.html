        <ul class = "wheellist">
            <li><strong>1. Unusual Birth or Childhood:</strong> Rama is born as the divine incarnation of Lord Vishnu to Queen Kausalya and King Dasharatha after a sacred ritual meant to grant children. His birth is unusual but significant, as it fulfills a cosmic need to defeat evil (Ravana).            </li><br><br>
            <li><strong>2. Call to Adventure:</strong> Rama’s journey begins when Sage Vishwamitra asks him to protect a sacred ritual from evil. This first call pulls him away from his normal life and sets him on the path of duty.            </li><br><br>
            <li><strong>3. Crossing the Threshold:</strong> The real departure from the familiar world occurs when Rama is exiled to the forest for 14 years because of Kaikeyi's demand. He leaves behind royal life and enters a world of hardship and transformation.            </li><br><br>
            <li><strong>4. Trials:</strong> Rama faces many tests: battling demons, surviving the wilderness, and more. The greatest trial was Sita’s abduction by Ravana, which made him go into war.            </li><br><br>
            <li><strong>5. Supernatural Helper:</strong> Hanuman plays an important role as Rama’s supernatural ally. With divine strength, the ability to grow and shrink, and devotion, Hanuman helps find Sita and fight Ravana’s forces.</li><br><br>
            <li><strong>6. Special Weapon:</strong> Rama wields Shiva’s divine bow and arrows, with supernatural weapons given to him by sages and gods. These symbolize his divine power and role as a protector.            </li><br><br>
            <li><strong>7. The Abyss:</strong> The abyss, or darkest moment, occurs during the battle with Ravana. Rama must confront the full force of evil and despair when Sita’s safety is uncertain and the war reaches its climax.</li><br><br>
            <li><strong>8. Transformation:</strong> After defeating Ravana and rescuing Sita, Rama undergoes a spiritual and emotional transformation. He proves his devotion to duty over personal feelings, especially with he handles Sita’s return and the expectations of his kingdom.            </li><br><br>
            <li><strong>9. The Return Home:</strong> Rama returns to Ayodhya after 14 years, welcomed with celebration. His coming home highlights the restoration of order and justice.            </li><br><br>
            <li><strong>10. Mastery of Two Worlds:</strong> Rama now is the balance between divine and human realms. As king, he rules with wisdom and compassion, with lessons from both his royal upbringing and his trials in exile.            </li><br><br>
