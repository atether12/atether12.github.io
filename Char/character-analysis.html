        <p>Analyzing key characters using the STEAL method:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speech:</strong> What does the character say?</li>
            <li><strong>Thoughts:</strong> What are their internal reflections?</li>
            <li><strong>Effects on Others:</strong> How do others react to them?</li>
            <li><strong>Actions:</strong> What decisions do they make?</li>
            <li><strong>Looks:</strong> How does their appearance contribute to characterization?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lakshmana is characterized by loyalty and dedication, often speaking with emotion, especially when defending Rama. Upon hearing of Rama’s exile, he exclaims with rage: “Food kept for the lion is sought to be fed to the street puppy—so plans that doe-eyed Kaikeyi,” highlighting his indignation at the injustice and his unwavering support for his brother (Narayan 29). Though his inner thoughts are not explored deeply, his actions demonstrate his loyalty. He declares, “Whoever dares to oppose my aim will be destroyed,” telling that nothing will stop him from supporting Rama (Narayan 30). His loyalty makes Rama and Sita trust him, though it sometimes comes together with more passive characters. Lakshmana’s help, like preparing for exile alongside Rama, reflects his protective nature and sense of duty. Though his appearance is not really shown, he is illustrated as a warrior whose moral ideals are as important as his physical presence.<br><br>

            Ravana speaks with authority and arrogance, often using his words to justify wicked deeds. To Sita, he says, “My ten heads have never bowed to any god in any world. But I will take off my crowns and touch your feet with my brow,” revealing his pride and obsession (Narayan 48). Internally, Ravana is driven by lust and pride, which leads him to rationalize the abduction of Sita and ignoring warnings. He dismisses his brother's help by saying, “You began with agreeable sentences and sentiments but you go on prattling away like a madman”. Others view him as the embodiment of evil, and his towering figure with multiple heads and arms is both a symbol of greatness and pride.<br><br>
            
            Kaikeyi's manipulation is shown in her speech, especially when she demands Rama’s exile: “If one cannot depend on the promise of a famous king,” she hisses, “life is not worth living” (Narayan 28). Influenced by fear and Manthara’s manipulation, her words carry her insecurities. Her betrayal has consequences: “Oh, devilish one, you ordered him into exile!” cries Dasaratha, accusing her action as the root of his downfall (Narayan 28). Her beauty is noted, but it contrasts with the emotional and moral chaos she releases. Her story highlights how emotion and ambition can destabilize an entire kingdom.<br><br>
