        <p>Analyzing key characters using the STEAL method:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speech:</strong> What does the character say?</li>
            <li><strong>Thoughts:</strong> What are their internal reflections?</li>
            <li><strong>Effects on Others:</strong> How do others react to them?</li>
            <li><strong>Actions:</strong> What decisions do they make?</li>
            <li><strong>Looks:</strong> How does their appearance contribute to characterization?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lakshmana is characterized by loyalty and dedication, which is clearly shown in his speech. He often speaks with strong emotion, especially when defending Rama. Though his thoughts are not really shown in the Ramayana, his actions suggest a deep sense of duty and love for Rama, usually surpassing his own desires. His support affects others by inspiring trust, particularly from Rama and Sita, while also occasionally clashing with less passionate characters. His actions, such as building shelters during exile, highlight his nature and protectiveness. While his looks aren’t described in detail, he is shown as a strong, noble warrior, his physical presence matching his moral strength.<br><br>

            Ravana speaks with authority, using speech to assert his power and justify his actions, showing a sense of superiority. Internally, his thoughts reveal a mix of arrogance and obsession, particularly in his rationalizations for abducting Sita and challenging Rama. His presence has an effect on others: his subjects often devote themselves to him, but many characters, including the protagonists, view him as the embodiment of evil. His actions, including the kidnapping of Sita and refusal to return her even when warned, come from desire, leading to his destruction. His appearance, ten heads and a towering figure, adds to his stature and symbolizes his knowledge and ambition, but also his lack of self-control.<br><br>
            
            Kaikeyi uses speech manipulatively, especially when demanding Rama's exile, which reveals a transformation from caring stepmother to a figure of insecurity. Her thoughts, come from fear of losing status and by Manthara’s suggestions, show her inner conflict. Her choices deeply affect others. Her betrayal devastates King Dasharatha, shocks Rama, and enrages Bharata, changing the course of the story. Her actions, using her two boons to exile Rama, demonstrate decision-making driven by fear and ambition instead of spite. Though described as beautiful, her outward appearance contrasts sharply with her inner conflicts, highlighting her role as a figure with much emotion and influence.<br><br>
