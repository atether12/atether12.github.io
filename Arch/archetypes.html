        <h3><i>The Ramayana</i> features various archetypes that deepen its meaning.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Character Archetypes:</strong> Heroes, mentors, villains, and companions.</li>
            <li><strong>Divine Archetypes:</strong> Gods and supernatural beings shaping destiny.</li>
            <li><strong>Number Archetypes:</strong> The symbolic meaning behind numerical patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Archetypes:</strong> The significance of specific colors throughout the epic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Ramayana shows archetypes that deepen its meaning. Character archetypes are important to the epic: Rama is the hero, noble and virtuous, while Lakshmana and Hanuman serve as loyal companions, and Ravana stands as the villain, whose power and pride lead to his fall. Sage Vishwamitra and other sages show the mentor archetype, offering guidance to the protagonists. The epic also shows divine archetypes, with gods like Vishnu and Hanuman representing the belief that higher powers shape destiny. Number archetypes appear throughout the text—such as the 14 years of exile, symbolizing transformation, or Ravana’s ten heads, which signify his knowledge. Color archetypes help meaning. For example, blue is associated with divinity, as seen in Rama’s blue complexion, while gold often represents wealth or divine power, like in the golden deer used to trick Sita. Together, these archetypes help the narrative, connecting it to cosmic order.</p>
