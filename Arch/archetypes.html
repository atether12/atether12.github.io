        <h3><i>The Ramayana</i> features various archetypes that deepen its meaning.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Character Archetypes:</strong> Heroes, mentors, villains, and companions.</li>
            <li><strong>Divine Archetypes:</strong> Gods and supernatural beings shaping destiny.</li>
            <li><strong>Number Archetypes:</strong> The symbolic meaning behind numerical patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Archetypes:</strong> The significance of specific colors throughout the epic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Ramayana shows archetypes that deepen its meaning. Character archetypes are important to the epic like how  Rama is the hero, noble and virtuous. He is described by Hanuman as showing divine abilities: “None but Vishnu could have bent the bow of Shiva… my father Vayu Bhagavan commanded me, ‘You shall dedicate your life to the service of Vishnu’” (Narayan 52). Lakshmana and Hanuman serve as loyal companions; Hanuman becomes the embodiment of service. “Hanuman… knelt at his feet, looking up, with his palms pressed in worship, ready to spring into action at the slightest command” (Narayan 85). Ravana stands as the villain, his power and pride leading to his fall. His form is described in battle: “Ravana… used ten [bows] with his twenty arms, multiplying his attack tenfold; but Rama stood unhurt” (Narayan 28). Sage Viswamitra and others show the mentor archetype. When Dasaratha does not want to send Rama, Viswamitra replies, “If you cannot send Rama, I need none else” and prepares to leave, until Vasishtha comes in, calling it “a privilege that Rama’s help should be sought” (Narayan 6). Divine archetypes also appear, with Rama as Vishnu incarnated and Hanuman as the son of Vayu, the wind god: “I am the son of Vayu and Anjana. I am called Anjaneya” (Narayan 51). Number archetypes deepen the symbolism—Rama's 14-year exile is important: “Yes, fourteen years hence. That was our father’s wish… I shall rule on behalf of that symbol. I will not re-enter Ayodhya until you come back” (Narayan 34). Ravana’s ten heads, mentioned during his final battle, signify both might and greed: “Rama’s crescent-shaped weapon was continuously busy as Ravana’s heads kept cropping up” (Narayan 80). Color archetypes appear too. Rama’s divine identity –Vishnu– is associated with a blue complexion, though Narayan’s version emphasizes his spiritual characteristics more than his skin color. Gold appears symbolically in the golden deer, which Sita desires and which leads to her abduction—illustrating illusion and temptation. Together, these archetypes carry the story, linking characters to cosmic forces and moral ideas.
