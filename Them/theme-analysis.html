            <p>One of the central themes in The Ramayana is dharma. From the beginning, characters are faced with choices that test their commitment to their roles. Rama shows this theme clearly when he accepts his exile to honor his father's word, showing that sacrifice is sometimes needed to uphold virtue. As the story progresses, other characters like Lakshmana and Bharata also struggle with their duties, showing how dharma is not always clear and can come into conflict with emotions. This theme influences the characters' decisions and the course of the plot. For instance, Kaikeyi’s sense of duty to secure her son’s future, even when misguided, changes the destiny of the kingdom. In the end, the theme of duty helps along the framework of the epic, showing that sticking to dharma, even in trials, is key to order and justice in the world.</p>
