            <p>One of the central themes in The Ramayana is dharma. From the beginning, characters are faced with choices that test their commitment to their roles. Rama shows this theme clearly when he accepts his exile to honor his father's word, showing that sacrifice is sometimes needed to uphold dharma. This theme is foreshadowed in his childhood, when Sage Viswamithra requests Rama's help and insists, “I want Rama to go with me. If you are not willing, you may say so” (Narayan 6). This moment shows how dharma sometimes calls for difficult choices. As the story goes on, other characters like Lakshmana and Bharata also struggle with their duties, showing how dharma is not always clear and can come into conflict with emotions. This theme influences the characters' decisions and the course of the plot. For instance, Kaikeyi’s sense of duty to secure her son’s future, even when misguided, changes the destiny of the kingdom: “If one cannot depend on the promise of a famous king, life is not worth living” (Narayan 28). In the end, the theme of duty helps shape the framework of the epic, showing that sticking to dharma, even in trials, is key to order and justice in the world.
